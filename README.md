# ANN-VS-COMPACT-MODEL
## Description of the Model
  Different from the general ANN-based Compact model, we would like to add the physical model(Virtual Source Model) to the 
  ANN network to normalize the learning process. We expect the modified model could be more precise, learning more fast and
  have less network complexity.
